# TWEETKOV

Tweetkov takes your chosen Twitter user, and builds a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) based tweet using the original TL as learning corpus. The first time retrieving the TL might take a few seconds.

# INSTALL

You can install it from the repository. Create a virtual environment and install the `requirements.txt` However, there is a small checklist of things you will need: 

- Your own Twitter API credentials
- A PostgreSQL installation

I will provide a template schema for the DB and for the `.env` file shortly.
